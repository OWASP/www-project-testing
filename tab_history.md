The OWASP Testing guide originated in 2003 with Dan Cuthbert as one of the original editors. It was handed over to Eoin Keary in 2005 and moved onto the then new OWASP wiki when it came online. Being in a wiki is easier for people to contribute and has made updating much easier. Matteo Meucci took on the Testing guide after Eoin and shepherded it through the version 2 and version 3 updates, which have been significant improvements.
